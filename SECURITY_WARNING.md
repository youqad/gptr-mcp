# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Exposed API Keys Detected

During the parallel verification process, the following security issues were identified:

### üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

1. **Regenerate ALL API Keys**
   - OpenAI API Key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Tavily API Key: https://app.tavily.com/

2. **File Permissions Fixed**
   - `.env` permissions changed from 644 (world-readable) to 600 (owner-only) ‚úÖ

3. **Best Practices**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables with ${VAR} interpolation in configs
   - Consider using a secrets manager or keychain
   - Regularly rotate API keys

### Security Status After Fixes

- ‚úÖ File permissions corrected (600)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  API keys still present in .env (required for functionality)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Keys may be compromised if previously exposed
- ‚úÖ Configuration uses ${VAR} interpolation correctly

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Regenerate all API keys immediately**
2. Update `.env` with new keys
3. Never share or commit the `.env` file
4. Consider using system keychain for production deployments
